M.S.F SAHRA — Portfolio

Overview

This is a clean, mobile-friendly portfolio template built for a Biomedical Technology student (M.S.F SAHRA). It uses plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript and includes accessible, responsive design and small interactive features.

Features
- Simple, professional medical-themed color palette (blue/green/white)
- Smooth scroll navigation and mobile menu
- Dark mode toggle (saves preference)
- Resume download (sample .txt generated by JS — replace with your real resume file)
- Button hover effects and simple reveal animations
- Profile photo placeholder and optional enhancements included

Files
- `index.html` — main markup (semantic sections, skip link)
- `styles.css` — responsive styles (mobile-first)
- `scripts.js` — interactions: smooth scroll, dark mode, resume download, alerts, reveal-on-scroll

Short one-line prompt (quick use):
“Design a responsive personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a Biomedical Technology student with a clean, modern, medical-themed layout.”

How to use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview locally.
2. Replace placeholder photo, contact email, and project details with your real content.
3. Replace the generated resume download with your actual resume file (update the `downloadResume` handler in `scripts.js` or link to a static file).
4. Customize colors in `styles.css` variables as needed.

Notes
- The sample resume download currently creates a `.txt` file for quick demo purposes; swap this for a real PDF for production.
- All code includes comments to guide edits.
